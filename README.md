# BLS12-381 Key Generation in Rust

This Rust project demonstrates generating a BLS12-381 public key from a given secret key using the `blst` crate. The program takes a secret key, generates the corresponding public key, and outputs it in hexadecimal format.

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (the Rust package manager). To install Rust and Cargo, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aligedikli/lambdaworks_BLS12-381.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd lambdaworks_BLS12-381
```

3. Build the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Usage

Run the program using Cargo:

```sh
cargo run
```

Upon running, the program will generate and print a BLS12-381 public key based on a predefined secret key.
